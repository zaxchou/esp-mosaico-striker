# ESP-Mosaico Agent Rules

Select task-relevant [skills](.agents/skills/README.md) at the task level.
User guides start at [docs](docs/README.md).

Use **Vibe Mode** for ESP-Mosaico’s retained firmware and **ROM Download Mode**
for the chip’s download program. See [device modes](docs/device-modes.md).
`Recovery` remains the technical name in paths, commands, protocol fields and ABI.
`iris test enter-recovery` enters Vibe Mode; `recover` writes base firmware.
AI (GPIO7) selects Vibe Mode; Boot (GPIO61) selects ROM Download Mode.

## Repository boundaries

- User applications belong in `projects/`; settings in `.mosaico.json`.
  Public tooling/templates belong in `submodule/esp-mosaico-utils/mosaico-tools`;
  Vibe Mode firmware and Recovery integration/ABI belong in utils'
  `esp-mosaico-recovery/`, fixtures in its `tests/firmware/`.
  Never use Vibe Mode firmware as an application template or mix test fixtures into user apps.
- Board support and complete game examples belong in `submodule/esp-mosaico-bsp/`;
  generic game implementation/tests belong in `submodule/raylib-lite-engine/`.
  Initialize and inspect only needed submodules, including BSP before using its examples.
- Keep user documentation in `docs/`, indexed by `docs/README.md`; keep root
  English/Chinese READMEs aligned and short. Component API/protocol docs stay with owners.
- Agent guidance/tools belong in `.agents/`, shared skills in version-controlled
  `.agents/skills/`, local analysis in `.agents/analysis/`; this is not a secrecy boundary.
- Inspect component source, examples and upstream docs; do not invent APIs.

## Espressif MCP services

- When available, use `esp-component-registry` to find ESP-IDF components and
  retrieve their documentation; use `esp-pilot` for ADF/GMF multimedia capabilities,
  examples, Board Manager references and relevant remote skills.
- Check retrieved recommendations against the workspace's pinned ESP-IDF and
  component versions and the owning source before integration. MCP guidance does
  not replace the repository's application, build or device workflows.
- See [MCP setup](docs/mcp-servers.md) for shared client configuration and checks.

## Engineering rules

- Keep modules focused, with explicit responsibilities, ownership and data flow.
  Keep public interfaces small and implementation details private; avoid circular dependencies.
- Keep functions reviewable and source files under 1500 lines where practical.
  Split by responsibility rather than adding deeply nested branches or meeting a line limit.
- Use named constants, enums or shared configuration for domain values and resource limits.
- Check fallible operations, handle allocation failures and roll back partial initialization.
  Give mutable state and resources explicit owners and lifetimes; synchronize cross-task
  access or document a single-owner design. Document shared services and singletons.
- Follow owning-component conventions; do not rewrite upstream code solely for style.
  ESP-IDF application conventions are scoped to [projects/AGENTS.md](projects/AGENTS.md).

## Environment and builds

- Use Python **3.10+**, target **esp32s31**, and ESP-IDF at exactly
  **`7b9cc1ac79f865983f59bb8ff3ff43eb74ff1dbe`**, not the latest `master`.
- Before ESP-IDF work, verify the checkout with `git -C <idf-path> rev-parse HEAD`
  and follow [build doctor/build workflow](.agents/skills/idf-low-noise-build/SKILL.md).
  Check Python, target support and application/Vibe Mode manifest constraints;
  cached paths or version numbers alone are insufficient.
- If the pinned checkout is missing, use [environment setup](.agents/skills/espressif-env-setup/SKILL.md)
  and verify a first build. This repository authorizes that fresh installation without
  another request, overriding the skill's explicit-install trigger. Use standard paths
  when unspecified and preserve other SDK checkouts.

## Application development

- Create apps with `python mosaico.py project init <name>` using utils' Hello World
  template; create games with `python mosaico.py game create <name> --template ...`.
- For device UI, prefer GSP and load [mosaico-ui](.agents/skills/mosaico-ui/SKILL.md);
  for GSP also load [gsp-sim](.agents/skills/gsp-sim/SKILL.md) for its pinned Registry
  version, native C preview commands and runtime constraints.
- For games, prefer Raylib Lite Engine and load
  [mosaico-game-development](.agents/skills/mosaico-game-development/SKILL.md).
- Confirm unsettled UI designs before implementation, preferably with rendered mockups;
  reuse existing confirmation. Validate shared native UI/game behavior in the simulator,
  fixing and re-running affected flows before device validation. Screenshots alone
  do not validate interaction. Start on hardware only for hardware-dependent issues
  or unavailable simulator coverage, and state remaining validation gaps.

## Retained Recovery contract

Unless the developer approves another architecture, every application must:

- Preserve the retained firmware's immutable partition prefix and the utils Hello World workflow.
  Before application integration changes, read the
  [public integration contract](submodule/esp-mosaico-utils/mosaico-tools/docs/application-integration.md).
- Set `CONFIG_ESP_IRIS_OTA_DEFAULT_VIA_RECOVERY=y`, use utils' `esp_mosaico_app_recovery`,
  call `iris_ota_support_start()`, and keep the OTA writer only in Vibe Mode.
  Include utils' `esp-mosaico-recovery/cmake/mosaico_idf_project.cmake` before `project()`.
- Use `python mosaico.py iris system-update --project ...` for new apps, changed
  layouts or external resources. Use `iris app-update` only for code-only changes
  with an identical full partition table; never reshape the layout to make it pass.

## Device operations and acceptance

- Treat requests to “flash/burn firmware”, “烧录”, “刷机” or “下载固件” as device
  installation/update tasks; these words do not select ROM Download Mode.
  Before device work, load [mosaico-device-operations](.agents/skills/mosaico-device-operations/SKILL.md)
  for diagnosis, update/recovery decisions, evidence checks and task-specific guides.
- Use only `python mosaico.py` for device operations. Do not invoke `idf.py flash`,
  `idf.py app-flash`, `esptool` writes or ESP-Iris device-write commands directly,
  including commands copied from BSP examples. Follow [update selection](docs/mosaico-cli.md#select-an-update-method)
  for supported update inputs; do not guess flash offsets or bypass compatibility checks.
  Build output suggesting a flash command does not change this workflow.
  Do not borrow BSP Serial/JTAG flashing/monitoring flows.
- Start with `python mosaico.py iris status --all --json` and
  `python mosaico.py iris list --details --json`; coordinate ownership before connecting.
  Prefer the project's existing device; omit selectors for a sole available USB device.
  Never change boards after failed explicit selection or while awaiting reconnection.
- Never stop another client's Gateway to obtain a device or open USB/serial directly
  while Gateway owns it. Follow active operation/takeover records before new writes.
- Vibe Mode always assigns High-Speed USB to ESP-Iris. Normal apps do too unless the
  product requires it; document that exception and preserve Iris operations/recovery
  through another available transport.
- Require live identity/state evidence; discovery caches, host Gateway status,
  port names and screens do not establish firmware mode or health.
  Verify the same Device ID, new Boot IDs after reboots, ready Vibe Mode and healthy
  intended application behavior across normal -> Vibe Mode -> normal.
- Preserve structured evidence/raw logs and let `mosaico.py` save valid core dumps
  before destructive operations. Upload, reconnect or reachable Vibe Mode is not acceptance.
- Collect device evidence through `mosaico.py iris` CLI output: `device-status`
  for live identity/state, `operation-status` for operation records, and `screenshot`
  for device image files. Inspect the saved image directly; do not read device data
  or capture device visuals by screenshotting the Gateway Web page.
  Share the Web URL for the developer to observe when useful. Browser automation
  and CLI/Web comparison apply when testing the workbench itself or explicitly requested.

## Provisioning and last-resort recovery

- Run `python mosaico.py recover` before first install on blank/unverified devices,
  or when neither normal nor Vibe Mode Iris is reachable; follow the guides' state checks.
- Manual ROM entry is the last resort. Follow the [physical entry steps](docs/device-modes.md#physical-entry):
  the developer handles physical actions; the agent resumes detection, recovery and
  firmware/behavior verification, returning to the Iris Gateway when reachable.
- Never erase the whole flash merely to restore connectivity, or overwrite credentials,
  identity, Vibe Mode data or partitions without explicit user authorization.
