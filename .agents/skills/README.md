# ESP-Mosaico repository skills

These shared skills are versioned with the workspace in `.agents/skills/`.
Read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for repository-wide rules and task-level routing.
Select each skill from the user's task and its stated scope. A task may use several
skills, but each skill must remain independent: no peer names, discovery, loading,
or links to another skill's instructions or resources. Keep its own prerequisites,
workflow and outputs explicit; reference shared docs, source and tools directly.
Developer-facing guides start at the [documentation index](../../docs/README.md).
