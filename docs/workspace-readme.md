# ESP-Mosaico Vibe

[简体中文](README_CN.md)

A get-started workspace for developing ESP-Mosaico applications with an AI coding
agent. The repository supplies the CLI entry, workspace settings, pinned
submodules, documentation and Agent guidance. Applications are created on demand;

## Create an application

This workspace requires **Python 3.10+**. Firmware builds use ESP-IDF `master`
at **`7b9cc1ac79f865983f59bb8ff3ff43eb74ff1dbe`** for `esp32s31`.
Creation does not require ESP-IDF, a board, BSP or the game engine.
Use `python3` in the commands below if your system has no `python` command.

```sh
git submodule update --init submodule/esp-mosaico-utils
python mosaico.py project init my_app
```

This creates `projects/my_app` from the utils-owned Hello World template without
changing the default project. `--dry-run` writes nothing; existing targets are
never overwritten. See [project creation](docs/project-init.md).

Use **Vibe Mode** for device installation and maintenance, and **ROM Download Mode**
for low-level flashing. See [device modes](docs/device-modes.md) for their purposes,
buttons and commands.

## Preview and install

```sh
git submodule update --init submodule/esp-mosaico-bsp
# Activate the pinned ESP-IDF environment and build the generated application.
python submodule/esp-mosaico-utils/mosaico-tools/skills/idf-low-noise-build/scripts/idf_low_noise_build.py --project projects/my_app doctor
python submodule/esp-mosaico-utils/mosaico-tools/skills/idf-low-noise-build/scripts/idf_low_noise_build.py --project projects/my_app build
python mosaico.py project sim --project projects/my_app --interactive
```

GSP preview uses the same portable C UI and GSP 1.5.1 scene as the device.
After design confirmation, find and fix UI rendering and interaction problems
in the simulator first, then validate on hardware; see [the workflow](docs/project-init.md).
For the first installation on a blank or unverified board, run `python mosaico.py recover`,
then `python mosaico.py iris system-update --project projects/my_app`.
Use `iris app-update` only for code changes with the same complete partition table
and resources. Device operations always go through the product CLI.

## Workspace ownership

| Repository | Maintains |
| --- | --- |
| This workspace | Entry, configuration, Agent workflows, consumer integration checks |
| [utils](https://github.com/esp-mosaico/esp-mosaico-utils) | CLI, Vibe Mode firmware, shared application components and Hello World template |
| [BSP](https://github.com/esp-mosaico/esp-mosaico-bsp) | Board support and complete examples, including games |
| [Raylib Lite Engine](https://github.com/espressif2022/raylib-lite-engine) | Game runtime, renderer, assets and Host simulator |

Prefer Raylib Lite Engine for games, create from BSP `examples/`, and validate
visuals and gameplay in its simulator first; see the [game entry](docs/game-development.md).
Initialize the engine only when developing games. Generated applications use
relative references: move or clone the whole workspace, initialize its pinned
dependencies and rebuild. Single-application export and old workspace path
compatibility are outside this layout. See [migration notes](docs/workspace-migration.md).

Shared [Espressif MCP configuration](docs/mcp-servers.md) connects Codex, Claude Code
and Cursor to ESP Pilot and the ESP Component Registry.

Start with the [documentation index](docs/README.md). Agents follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
and the [skill index](.agents/skills/README.md). For ongoing observation,
`python mosaico.py iris run --project projects/my_app` prints the Gateway Web
workbench URL; see the [Gateway guide](docs/project-gateway.md).
