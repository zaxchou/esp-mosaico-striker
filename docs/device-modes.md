# Device modes

[简体中文](device-modes_CN.md) | [Documentation index](README.md)

**Vibe Mode** is ESP-Mosaico's built-in application installation and device
maintenance mode. It runs ESP-Iris and provides application updates, Wi-Fi setup
and **Download Ideas**. Download Ideas retrieves applications over the network;
it does not put the chip in ROM Download Mode.

| Mode | What runs | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal application | Your application; ESP-Iris is available when integrated and started | Run, debug and verify your application |
| Vibe Mode | Retained firmware in the Flash `factory` partition, including ESP-Iris | Install/update applications and maintain the device |
| ROM Download Mode | The chip's built-in firmware download program, without ESP-Iris | Provision a blank device or restore unusable base firmware |

Agents can connect to either a normal application with ESP-Iris or Vibe Mode.
An offline device or failed handshake does not establish ROM mode or damaged
firmware. Check ownership, active operations and the connection first, following
the [live evidence rules](project-gateway.md#live-evidence-and-next-steps).

## Choose an operation

`python mosaico.py iris test enter-recovery` enters the existing Vibe Mode from
a reachable normal application without installing firmware. Application update
commands manage this transition automatically.

`python mosaico.py recover` writes base firmware and then verifies Vibe Mode.
It can start from a connected device; manual ROM entry is only needed when the
workflow requests it. For provisioning conditions and application updates, follow
[update selection](mosaico-cli.md#select-an-update-method); Wi-Fi and Download Ideas
commands are in the [CLI reference](mosaico-cli.md#command-responsibilities).

## Physical entry

- **Vibe Mode — AI button (GPIO7):** with a working Mosaico bootloader and retained
  firmware, hold AI while powering on, then release after Vibe Mode starts.
  The bootloader selects `factory` for this boot without changing OTA selection.
- **ROM Download Mode — Boot button (GPIO61):** only when `recover` requests
  manual entry, power off, hold Boot (to the left of the USB-C port), and power
  on while holding it. Release Boot after ROM Download Mode entry and tell the
  agent the physical steps are complete. The agent verifies the ROM connection
  and resumes `recover`; Vibe Mode and ESP-Iris do not run in this mode.

These are different buttons and startup paths. After a one-boot AI-button entry,
restarting with AI released follows the existing OTA selection, if it is valid.
Application updates select and boot the installed app; verify its identity,
health and intended behavior. After ROM restoration, verify Vibe Mode readiness
before installing the intended application.

## Technical names

`Recovery` remains the technical name for the retained firmware, its ABI and
integration contract. The directory `esp-mosaico-recovery/`, `factory` partition,
`firmware_mode=recovery`, commands and API identifiers retain their names.
ESP-Iris Workbench may display **Recovery**, **Factory Recovery** or **Recovery
firmware**; on ESP-Mosaico these refer to Vibe Mode. The state `needs_recovery`
describes a condition requiring attention, not the current firmware mode.
