# Game creation and simulation

[简体中文](game-development_CN.md) | [Documentation index](README.md)

Prefer **Raylib Lite Engine** (`submodule/raylib-lite-engine`) for game applications.
Validate visuals and gameplay in the simulator, fix problems, then install on the
device. BSP `examples/` maintains the three complete games; the engine maintains
the shared runtime, rendering, asset tools and Host simulation. BSP examples can
be built from standalone clones: each example declares its pinned dependencies
and fetches them automatically.

```sh
git submodule update --init submodule/esp-mosaico-utils submodule/esp-mosaico-bsp submodule/raylib-lite-engine
python mosaico.py game create my_game
python mosaico.py game sim --project projects/my_game
python mosaico.py game sim --project projects/my_game --headless --frames 120
python mosaico.py game build --project projects/my_game
python mosaico.py iris system-update --project projects/my_game
```

The default template is `blank` (also selectable with `--template blank`). It
starts with an empty black canvas and shared C update, drawing and pointer-input
functions in `main/game.c`. Project identity is generated from your chosen name.
It includes the device/Host entry points and [Vibe Mode integration](device-modes.md), with no
example gameplay, atlas, sounds or external game resource partition to remove.
The small embedded GSP canvas placeholder is generated during firmware configuration.

For a complete example, select `--template sky-hop`, `--template tower-defense`
or `--template shooter`. These retain their example gameplay and resources.
`game new` is
equivalent to `game create`. Creation supports `--dry-run` and refuses to overwrite
existing targets. The Host requires a C compiler and Pillow; firmware requires an
ESP-IDF version that satisfies the project's constraints and supports ESP32-S31.
Omit `--headless` for interactive simulation.

The blank template exposes `phase`, `tick`, pointer coordinates/pressed state and
`state_hash` through Host JSON state; pause, resume and reset work before you add
gameplay. Use `--state-output state.json` with a headless run to save it. Add your
game's behavior to the shared C model and map new inputs in both the Host and
device adapters. The generated README describes each file.

Interactive simulation uses the C gameplay model and rendering code shared with
the device. Check visuals, animation, input feedback and complete gameplay flows,
including collisions, scoring, win/loss conditions and restart behavior as relevant
to the game. Recorded input can be replayed headlessly for repeatable checks.
Starting successfully or running for a fixed number of frames does not prove that
the game looks or plays correctly. Inspect the visuals and input results, and
re-run affected flows after fixes.

On the device, validate physical buttons, touch, display, audio and actual
performance. Host simulation cannot replace these hardware checks.
